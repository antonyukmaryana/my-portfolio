      <h2>My first week at Epicodus</h2>
      It was a very productive week. A lot of new information,
      intencity and excitment of learning and applying new things
      resulted in 10 projects.

      <h2>About me</h2> I am Ukrainian. For the last fifteen years
      I was travelling around the world, have lived in
       4 diferent countries and 3 different continents. I have
       two Master's degrees Educatin and Social Studies.
       I started working as a teacher when I was 19. In Ukraine
       I was teaching English, in Singapore I was teaching
       Russian, in US i was working as a teacher of Math
       (elementary, middle and high schools). For a
       brief momemnt I was working as a contractor for Apple
        and Google (localization) when I was living in Bay Area.
        Since I remember I always enjoyed math and problem-solving
         process. It naturally drew me in trying online coding
         classes which I enjoyed tremendously. Next step,
         joing a bootcamp was a logic step to bring
         "my relationship" with coding to the next level.

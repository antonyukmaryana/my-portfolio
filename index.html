                    <p>I was born in Ukraine. For the last fifteen years
                        I was traveling around the world, have lived in
                        4 diferent countries and 3 different continents. I have
                        two Master's degrees - Education and Social Studies.
                        I started working as a teacher when I was 19. In Ukraine
                        I was teaching English, in Singapore I was teaching
                        Russian, in US I was working as a teacher of Math
                        (elementary, middle and high schools). For a
                        brief momemnt I was working as a contractor for Apple
                        and Google in localization when I was living in Bay Area.
                        Since I remember I always enjoyed math and problem-solving
                        process. It naturally drew me in trying online coding
                        classes which I enjoyed tremendously. Joining a bootcamp was a logic step
                        to bring "my relationship" with coding to the next level.
